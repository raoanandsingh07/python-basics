        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "\n",
        " it is popular beacuse,\n",
        "- very ease of learning.\n",
        "- Versatility (used in web development, data science, automation, etc.).\n",
        "- a lot of libraries.\n",
        "- huge active community.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- An interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line. It translates high-level code into machine-readable instructions during runtime, rather than compiling it beforehand like in some other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pre-defined keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in Python. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the language, like if, else, for, while, class, def, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved by the language to perform specific functions. For example, while = 5 would result in a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- object/container whose state or value can be changed after they are created are called as mutable ojbects or container.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lists are designed to be dynamic and modifiable — ideal for use cases where data changes frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tuples are designed for fixed data collections and often used for performance and safety — as they are immutable, they prevent accidental changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n",
        "- == checks for value equality (do they contain the same data?).\n",
        "\n",
        "- is checks for identity (do they refer to the exact same object in memory?).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n",
        "\n",
        " - and: True if both statements are true.\n",
        "\n",
        " - or: True if at least one statement is true.\n",
        "\n",
        " - not: Reverses the result (True becomes False and vice versa).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Type casting, also referred to as type conversion, is the process of changing one data type to another in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "- implicit: Python automatically converts data types.\n",
        "Example: 3 + 4.0 results in 7.0 (int is converted to float).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Explicit: Programmer manually converts the type using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Conditional statements allow decision-making in programs. They let the code execute different blocks based on conditions, such as with if, elif, and else.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The elif (short for else if) checks additional conditions if the if condition is false.It allows multiple branches of logic without nesting multiple if statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "- while loop>> repeatedly exxecute a block of code until a condition is met\n",
        "- for loop>>Used when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a sequence (like a list, string).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A while loop is better when the loop should continue until a condition becomes false, rather than a fixed number of times.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Imagine you're creating a program that asks a user to enter a password, and you want to keep prompting the user until they enter the correct password. In this case, you don’t know in advance how many attempts the user will need — so a while loop is more appropriate.\n"
